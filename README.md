# motoralarm

This project I created in 2014 after my bike had been stolen. It consists of an Android app that uses the motion sensor to send
an alarm message to your phone. On your phone you have another app (AlarmView) that makes a siren sound and shows the current location of 
your bike on a map.
The apps communicate via a server (included here, as an Eclipse project).
